# Pre Introduction

Before we dive into Frontend development. We ensure to know about web architecture. 


## What is web architecutre 

That is backbone of the internet. 
That encompasses the structure, organization, and interaction of various components that make up a web system.
It's includes both client and server side elements, as well as the protocols and standards that facilitate communication between them.
So, Understanding of web architecture is very crucial for developers, designers and business owner alike.

These are the most crucial things in web architecutre.

### Client-Server Model

The client-server model form is the foundation of web architecture, with client (such as web browsers or mobile apps) requesting and receiving resource from servers.
The SOC (Separation of concerns) allows for scalability, as servers can handle multiple client requests simultaneously, and clients can interact with various servers across the web.

### Three-Tire Architecture 

Three-tier architecture further divides the application into three logical layers: presentation (client), application (server), and data (database).
This modular approach enhances scalability, maintainability, and reusability, as each layer can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### RESTful Architecture

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a widely adopted architectural style for designing networked applications.
RESTful systems are characterized by stateless communication, resource-based URLs, and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
This simplicity and flexibility make REST an ideal choice for building scalable and interoperable web APIs.

### Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture decomposes applications into small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
Each service focuses on a specific business function and communicates with other services via lightweight protocols like HTTP or messaging queues.
Microservices promote agility, allowing teams to iterate rapidly, scale horizontally, and adopt polyglot architectures.
