# Layout Elements

HTML layout elements are fundamental components used to structure and organize content within a web page. These elements provide a framework for arranging different sections of content in a logical and visually appealing manner. Some common HTML layout elements include:

| Element name       | Description                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| header             | Defines the header section of a webpage, typically containing branding, navigation menus, and introductory content.|
| nav                | Represents a navigation menu, usually containing links to various sections or pages within the website. |
| main               | Encloses the primary content of the webpage, excluding headers, footers, and navigation menus. It often contains articles, blog posts, or the main functional components of the page. |
| article            | Defines a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post, news article, or forum post, that can be independently distributed or reused. |
| section            | Divides the content into thematic groups or sections, making it easier to organize and style related information. |
| aside              | Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content, such as sidebars, advertisements, or supplementary information. |
| footer             | Specifies the footer section of a webpage, typically containing copyright information, contact details, or links to related resources. |
| div                | A generic container element used to group and style content blocks, providing flexibility in layout design. |
