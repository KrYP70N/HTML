# TEXT AND FORMATTING

At its core, HTML is designed to represent text-based content. HTML documents consist of plain text combined with special markup tags that define the structure and appearance of the content. These markup tags, known as HTML elements, allow developers to apply formatting, styling, and semantic meaning to text.

## Basic Text Formatting Elements

HTML provides a set of basic text formatting tags that developers can use to style text content within web pages. These tags include:

| Element Name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| `<b>`        | defines bold text, without any extra importance. |
| `<i>`        | content inside is typically displayed in italic, without any extra emphasized. |
| `<em>`       | Renders text in italicized style, indicating emphasis. |
| `<u>`        | Renders text with an underline decoration, typically used for hyperlinks. |
| `<strike>`   | Renders text with a strikethrough effect, indicating deleted or obsolete content. |
| `<sub>`      | Renders text as subscript, appearing slightly below the baseline. |
| `<sup>`      | Renders text as superscript, appearing slightly above the baseline. |
| `<samp>`     | Renders text in a monospace font, indicating sample output or literal text. |
| `<code>`     | Renders text in a monospace font, indicating computer code or output. |
| `<small>`    | element defines smaller text |
| `<mark>`     | element defines text that should be marked or highlighted |

## Semetic Text Elements

In addition to basic formatting tags, HTML introduces semantic text elements that convey meaning and structure to text-based content. These elements include:

| Element Name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| `<strong>`       | defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold. |
| `<em>`           | element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. |
| `<abbr>`         | Defines an abbreviation or acronym, typically displaying a tooltip with the full expanded text. |
| `<cite>`         | Renders text in italics, indicating the title of a work or a citation. |
| `<del>`          | element defines text that has been deleted from a document, usually strike a line through deleted text. |
| `<ins>`          | element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text |
| `<p>`            | used to define paragraphs of text |
| `<h1>` to `<h6>` | Heading elements used to define headings of varying levels of importance, with `<h1>` being the highest and `<h6>` being the lowest. |
| `<span>`         | Generic inline container used to apply styling or scripting to a specific section of text. |
